# class is blueprint for creating object
# class is kinda a thing that is empty and 
# When filled becomes your object.
# Consider class as a blank form of college and
# When filed it becomes your filled form like,i.e.- an object 
# So like that remember
#Ex. of class:-
class Employee:
    name='hsl'
    language='PY'
    salary=10000 # **name,salary,language are class attributes**

hsl1= Employee()#Any name like hsl1 or any other variable can be used here and below AND MOST IMPORTNATLY HERE *hsl1* is an *object* and also **memory mein class ka data tabhi jaata hai jab object banta hai so remember** imp-*,**-v.imp
print(hsl1.name,hsl1.language,hsl1.salary)
# NOW SOME EXAMPLES:-
soham=Employee()
soham.name="Soham Sikdar"
print(soham.name,soham.salary,soham.language)
